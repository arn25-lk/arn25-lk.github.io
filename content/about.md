# About Me

I just graduated with a First Class Honours from the University of Edinburgh.

Theory underpins innovation, it balances nuance and rigour with wonder and beauty.

## Research Overview

I am quite interested in the intersection of Complexity Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory and Learning Theory.
