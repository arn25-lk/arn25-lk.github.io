# About Me

I just graduated with a First Class Honours from the University of Edinburgh. I also served as the Vice-President of TypeSIG - the university's only CS theory-focused student society.

Theory underpins innovation, it balances nuance and rigour with wonder and beauty.

Outreach in theoretical computer science means a lot to me. In February 2025, I helped organize [**TUPLES 2025**](https://typesig.pl/tuples2025/) which is a student-run conference where researchers from across the UK gave talks aimed at students. It was a great way to make cutting-edge theory feel more accessible and inspiring.

## Research Overview

I am quite interested in the intersection of Complexity Theory, Algorithmic Game Theory and Learning Theory.
