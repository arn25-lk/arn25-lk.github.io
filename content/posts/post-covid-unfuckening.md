Here are some missteps and terrible habits I cultivated during the COVID years (2020-2023). It stands to reason that most, if not all, were a result of delaying the kind of activity that I am doing presently: *thorough introspection*.

### Losing a Sense of Wonder

Since COVID we have normalized pushing away humanly needs to extract every ounce of productivity we possibly can. We then confused this war within ourselves as a noble cause towards an end. I did so as well.

It was in the middle of COVID and in my first year of university when I truly lost any sense of wonder and intrigue about the world. Yes, I did my assignments on time, got some really high grades as well; but I was quite sure there was more to university. I could not go out to make friends, spend guilt-free time alone, explore the city or join any clubs for obvious reasons. But I also did not read deeply, care more than the required amount, start studying for exams more than 3 days before them or make ambitious plans towards my career.

As a result, I stopped trying. It didn't seem too good for the people around me either. I didn't find too many passionate people in my first and second years and it felt like - with the exception of a few - we were all in the same but different boat. In the coming years, I found that this boat had miraculously stayed afloat for most, some had hopped off of it entirely, and for few a courageous bunch, it had sunk to the bottom with themselves in it.

**How did I Unf\*k This**
It is not easy to fix this. The human body is quite good at adapting and keen on maintaining it's homeostasis. It will morph itself around a unremarkable, fruitless and non-wondrous existence.

### Impatience


### Developing Unhealthy Academic Masochism


### Lack of Boundaries
